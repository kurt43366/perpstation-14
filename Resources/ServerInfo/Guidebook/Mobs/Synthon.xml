  When parts of the station are missing air, Synthons become invaluable, taking on the dangerous roles that organic crew members would struggle with.
  Whether repairing breaches, working in atmospherically compromised areas, or conducting maintenance in exposed regions, they can operate effectively in places where other crew would need special suits or equipment.
  
  Synthons are more resilient to pressure changes and thrive in high-risk areas such as engine rooms or space mining operations.
  However, while they can handle extreme conditions better than organics, prolonged exposure to high or low-pressure environments without proper management will still cause damage over time.

  Synthons excel in industrial, engineering, and dangerous tasks, often operating in vacuum or hazardous environments for extended periods.
  However, they must carefully manage their internal temperature, as prolonged exposure to vacuum without an atmosphere will lead to overheating.
  They can use their Heat Sink Vent ability to prevent critical failure in emergencies, but will need Robotics to replace it afterward.


  Synthons consume synthetic blood to stay operational, which depletes over time as they perform labor-intensive tasks.
  To restore their power, they must either consume food or receive specialized treatment in med-bay or chemistry to replenish their synthetic blood supply.
